    <h1>Future of Web</h1>
    <p>Web is changing yearly and quickly. The biggest evolution of web took place between 1998 and 2007. New languages emerged, design styles replaced one another, and new eras for animations and interactions were evolving. Since 2010 new programs are released daily to simplify prototyping and web designing for designers and clients.
    </p>
    <p>The future of web has larger possibilities than ever before. Many more languages have been created and the fact that it has become easier to develop and program websites proves the industry will be turning their attention and focus to other scalable and futuristic ideas, such as augmented reality and mobile. These “futuristic” approaches are flexible in terms of mobility, which is how we are mostly using technology today- on our smart phones, and on the go.
